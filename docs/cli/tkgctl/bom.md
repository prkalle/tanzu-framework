# Details on BoM usage in the TKG library

BoM stands for Bill of Materials. It's basically a file with a collection of dependent components required for the lifecycle management of Tanzu clusters.

## Introduction

Tanzu has 2 types of BoM files:

* a TKG BoM file   (1 file per TKG release)
* TKR BoM files (multiple files per TKG release)

### TKG BoM file

* This file contains information about TKG related components which are mainly required during the creation of management clusters.
  * It specifies the TKG version under the `release.version` key and the default TKR version under the `default.k8sVersion` key.
  * It also specifies cluster-api provider components, pinniped components, image repo information, and many more.

[A sample TKG BoM file is available here.](example-boms/tkg-bom.yaml)

### TKR BoM files

* These files contain information related to:
  * the specific k8s version,
  * node images to use with the kubernetes provider (vsphere, aws, azure) for the matching k8s version,
  * add-ons specific components.

[A sample TKR BoM file is available here.](example-boms/tkr-bom.yaml)

## Bundling BoM files into the TKG library

* The TKG BoM file (and TKR BoM files) are decoupled from the Tanzu CLI and the TKG library (`tkgctl`).
* Instead, the Tanzu CLI is compiled with a TKG Compatibility Image path (which is a build-time constant). At runtime, the CLI downloads this compatibility file and uses it to determine the location of the appropriate TKG/TKR BoM files (choosing the version that matches the version of the management-cluster plugin currently installed).  The CLI then downloads the correct BoM files to the user's machine. [Reference.](../../../tkg/tkgconfigupdater/ensure.go)

### Why do we need a TKG Compatibility Image?

If the BoM files were bundled with the CLI, and if, at a later time, there were a CVE fix for any images/components that are part of the TKG/TKR BoM files for an existing release, this would require a new CLI release.
By using a TKG Compatibility Image, a new CLI release can be avoided in such a case. The release team can publish a new Compatibility Image (using a new git tag) with updated TKG BoM paths for a given version of the management-cluster plugin.  The CLI would then download the new Compatibility Image (using the latest Image tag) and thereby be able to download and use the updated TKG/TKR BoM files while creating a new management cluster.

A sample compatibility file is shown below:

```yaml
version: v2
managementClusterPluginVersions:
- version: v1.5.1
  supportedTKGBomVersions:
  - imagePath: tkg-bom
    tag: v1.5.1
- version: v1.5.0
  supportedTKGBomVersions:
  - imagePath: tkg-bom
     tag: v1.5.0
```

Below is a new sample compatibility file after updating the BoM version (new BoM which has images/components with CVE fixes for v1.5.0). The new Compatibility Image would be pushed to an image repository along with an updated tag (e.g., **tkg/tkg-compatibility:v3**)

```yaml
version: v3
managementClusterPluginVersions:
  - version: v1.5.1
    supportedTKGBomVersions:
      - imagePath: tkg-bom
        tag: v1.5.1
  - version: v1.5.0
    supportedTKGBomVersions:
      - imagePath: tkg-bom
          tag: v1.5.0-patch
```

Notes:

* Once a management cluster is created, it runs the TKR controller which reconciles all the supported TKR BoM images and the TKR compatibility image from the Image registry and later creates configmaps and TKR resources in the management cluster using these images.
* For workload cluster creation, the CLI can download the necessary TKR BoM files to the user's local machine directly from the management cluster (using an existing ConfigMap on the management cluster).

### Why do we need to download the TKR BoM files locally?

* This is required because the cluster template creation logic is still running locally with the TKG library which internally uses YTT
* To generate cluster templates using YTT overlays easily we are downloading the TKR BoM files locally before generating the cluster templates
* This allows users to read and understand the content of the TKR BoM files for debugging purpose

## Updating the TKG Compatibility Image Path into the TKG library

If maintainers would like to permanently change the TKG Compatibility Image path, please follow the instructions below:

1. Update the `TKG_DEFAULT_IMAGE_REPOSITORY` and `TKG_DEFAULT_COMPATIBILITY_IMAGE_PATH` variables inside [Makefile](../../../Makefile)
2. Run `make configure-bom` which will update the build-time constants for downloading the TKG compatibility file.
3. Commit the `Makefile` changes alongside the changes generated to the constants file.

## How are the BoM files getting used in the CLI and the cluster template creation with ytt

### How are the BoM files getting used in the Tanzu CLI?

* TKG Compatibility file metadata is bundled into the TKG library as build-time constants
* When the `tkgctl` client gets created, as part of ensuring prerequisites, the tkg-compatibility file and BoM files are extracted to the BoM file location. For the tanzu CLI this location will be, `$HOME/.config/tanzu/tkg/compatibility` and `$HOME/.config/tanzu/tkg/bom` respectively. If there is a compatibility file already present in the user's local file system, the new compatibility file will not be downloaded. Users can choose to delete the existing compatibility file so that the tanzu CLI will download the latest compatibility file (alternatively, users can run `tanzu config init` or `tanzu management-cluster create --force-config-update -f <filename>`).
* The TKG Library implements the [tkgconfigbom](../../../tkg/tkgconfigbom/client.go) package which provides functions to read TKG and TKR BoM files.
* The CLI reads in these BoM files from the user's local filesystem and uses their content for various purposes, of which a few are listed below:
  * Uses the TKG BoM file to determine which image repository to use for provider installation and updates the images section under the TKG settings file `$HOME/.config/tanzu/tkg/config.yaml`
  * Reads the TKR BoM file to select the correct AMI or Azure image to use. Uses the same information for the purpose of vSphere VM template verification
  * Uses information in the TKR BoM to set configuration variables like `KUBERNETES_VERSION`, `AMI_ID`, `AZURE_IMAGE_*`, etc.
* Another use of BoM files is for cluster template generation.  In that case, the ytt library is used to directly read the BoM files as text files.  This is described in next section.

### How the cluster template creation with ytt uses BoM files?

* When creating a cluster template with ytt we read files mentioned in `cluster-template-definition-<plan>.yaml` which includes BoM files with file-mark `text-plain`. This means BoM files will be read in as plain-text files instead of as a base-template or overlay files.
* Once the BoM files are read into the ytt engine during the cluster template generation process, the code mentioned in `config_default.yaml` converts them to `data_values` as part of the ytt `boms` map. This shown below:

```yaml
#! ---------------------------------------------------------------------
#! BoM file processing, internal use only
#! ---------------------------------------------------------------------

#@ load("@ytt:yaml", "yaml")
#@ load("@ytt:data", "data")

#@ files = data.list()
boms:
  #@ for/end file in [ f for f in files if f.startswith("tkg-bom") or f.startswith("tkr-bom") or f.startswith("bom")]:
  - bom_name: #@ file
  bom_data: #@ yaml.decode(data.read(file))
```

* This will store all BoM files present under `$HOME/.config/tanzu/tkg/bom` into the `boms` array
* The TKG library sets the `TKG_DEFAULT_BOM` configuration variable before generating the cluster template which gets used to determine the default BoM file with helper functions
* ytt overlays have some getter helper functions which gets used during overlays: `get_default_tkr_bom_data`, `get_bom_data_for_tkr_name`, `get_default_tkg_bom_data`
* Using the functions mentioned above, ytt overlays are written in a way that reads the correct BoM file based on the given TKR and files in the correct image name and image tag.

## How the TKG library determines if the BoM files in the user's file system are outdated and need to be replaced?

* As part of [ensurePrerequisite](../../../tkg/tkgctl/client.go) whenever we create the `tkgctl` client, the [EnsureBOMFiles](../../../tkg/tkgconfigupdater/ensure.go) function is invoked
* This function checks the default TKG BoM file name (determined from the `tkg-compatibility` file) and compares it with the BoM file present in the user's local filesystem
* If the default TKG BoM filename does not exist, TKG will back up the old BoM directory and extract the bundled BoM file into the user's BoM directory
